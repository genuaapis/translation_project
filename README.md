Spring 4280 Program Translation Project

This is a semester-long project developing a translator from a language created by the professor into assembly.
Specifications for the language and the assembly are included.
The proj0 folder is for a warm-up exercise done at the start of the semester. The tree and parsing mechanisms are reused in the true project.
